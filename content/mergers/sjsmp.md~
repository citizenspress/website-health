description = "Hospital workers have seen more than our share of change in the workplace. Hospital mergers similar to the one between the Providence and St. Joe's and St. Mikesare happening in several Ontario communities. While there will be many workplace and organizational transitions, the merger also brings changes at the local CUPE union and bargaining unit level."

CUPE Local 1590 has represented employees at Providence Healthcare since 1973. Since then the Local has expanded to include employees of DTZ who also work at Providence Healthcare as well as employees at Hazelton Retirement Residence. Currently the membership includes 700 fulltime, part time and casual workers.

The Local’s first priorities are to negotiate strong collective agreements and protect the rights of our members. As a CUPE Local that is part of CUPE’s Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU) we are part of CUPE’s Central Agreement and have the strongest job security and job promotion language of any health care union in Ontario. In addition, we have negotiated wage increases and lump sum payments in each year of our collective agreement. If the employer violates the collective agreement grievances are filed and CUPE Local 1590 and OCHU have had many successes over the years including payment for damages for breach of the collective agreement.

Our Local is an active local so in addition to negotiating strong collective agreements and enforcing those agreements, the Local also ensures that issues of importance to the members such as violence in the workplace, health and safety, workload, creation of new jobs and semi-annual vacation planners are supported by the Local Executive members with achievable outcomes for our members. Beyond this the local supports and provides education opportunities for members and social events such as CUPE day celebrations.
