CUPE Local 3651 has represented the Full time service workers at Markham Stouffville Hospital since 1994. In 2015 we became the representative of the Part time Service workers at Markham Stouffville Hospital and negotiated their first Collective Agreement. CUPE Local 3651 now represents over 450 Full and Part time workers at Markham Stouffville Hospital.
 
As a member of OCHU, the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, we bargain centrally, and locally, for the Collective Agreement that has the strongest job protection language in the province of Ontario.
 
As a union we also have very strong language on wages, pensions, benefits, vacations, and seniority in our Collective Agreement. We have filed many grievances and have taken them to arbitration to protect our Collective Agreement with precedent setting wins in a few cases.
 
Local 3651 also has a strong focus on Health and Safety, working with the Hospital for the protection of all workers here.
    
Local 3651 executives work to represent all members, attend union education courses to broaden their knowledge of labour law and workplace issues to assist the members of Local 3651 whenever the need arises and to protect the Collective Agreement and the rights of the workers at Markham Stouffville Hospital.
