### What do we need to do to join CUPE?

A percentage of not less than 40% of the employees must sign union membership cards, then an application for certification is submitted to the Ontario Labour Relations Board.  One week later the Ontario Labour Relations Board holds a secret ballot vote at your workplace.  In order for the union to be successful fifty percent plus one of the employees who cast a ballot must vote in favour of the union.
