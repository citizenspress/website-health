When workplaces covered by PSLRTA amalgamate, merge or restructure, the Ontario Labour Relations Board (**OLRB**) will, in consultation with the affected unions and employers, determine what bargaining units are appropriate in the new workplace.

The **Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act** (PSLRTA) was passed in 1997 when the Ontario government began to downsize public services through mergers, amalgamations and restructurings in the municipal, school board and hospital sectors.

PSLRTA establishes certain rights for affected workers. It sets a framework to determine the appropriate bargaining units in an amalgamated workplace and which union should represent the workers.

In 2005 PSLRTA was expanded to apply to provincial government/LHIN-initiated health services integration and restructuring.

## What is PSLRTA?




The Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act (PSLRTA – pronounced pah-SLUR-tah) was passed in 1997 when the Ontario government began to downsize public services through mergers, amalgamations and restructurings in the municipal, school board and hospital sectors. In 2005 PSLRTA was expanded to apply to provincial government/LHIN-initiated health services integration and restructuring.

PSLRTA establishes certain rights for affected workers. It sets a framework to determine the appropriate bargaining units in an amalgamated workplace and which union should represent the workers.

## How does PSLRTA work?

When workplaces covered by PSLRTA amalgamate, merge or restructure, the Ontario Labour Relations Board (“OLRB”) will, in consultation with the affected unions and employers, determine what bargaining units are appropriate in the new workplace.

Should one union represent 80 percent or more of workers in the post-merger bargaining unit, the OLRB will simply declare that union to be the bargaining agent without a vote. Otherwise, all workers who would become members of the new bargaining unit are eligible to vote on which union they want to represent them at the new, merged workplace.

For example, if the newly merged bargaining unit includes employees from two separate unions and employees who were not represented by a union prior to the merger, all employees in the new bargaining unit would be entitled to vote.

If there are multiple unions and a “no union” option on the ballot, and no option achieves a majority of the votes, the option with the fewest votes will be dropped and a run-off vote will be conducted.

There will only be a “no union” option on the ballot if 40 percent or more of the appropriate bargaining unit were non-union prior to the merger.

## The Ontario Labour Relation Board's role

When a merger, amalgamation or restructuring is announced, any of the affected employers or unions may apply to the OLRB, and any of those parties may respond to the application. Workers without a union are not included in the process; the employers are presumed to represent the interests of the non-union employees.

The OLRB will determine if PSLRTA applies and will administer the process, including deciding the composition of the post-amalgamation bargaining units, who is involved in the process, what options will be on the ballot and how a campaign, if necessary, will be conducted.

The issues that the OLRB has to resolve are:

- Whether PSLRTA applies
- The number of bargaining units in the merged workplace
- The structure of those bargaining units
- The positions to be included in those bargaining units
- Which unions are parties to the process
- The unions that will be on the ballot
- Whether there will be a ballot option for “no union”
- The voter's list for each election (Note: an employee list is provided by the employer to the OLRB, and any of the unions involved can challenge the names on the list)
- How the union(s) will access the employees who they seek to represent. This is spelled out in an “access agreement”
- The time and location of the vote(s) The OLRB will assign an officer who will meet and work with both the employer and the unions to help them get to an agreement on these issues. If they can’t agree, the OLRB will hold a hearing. All parties involved (the employer and any unions the OLRB decided are parties to the merger) can have a voice at the hearing. Issues may also be resolved through written submissions. At the end of this process, the OLRB will issue its decision and the parties must abide by that decision. You must follow the terms of the Access Agreement during the campaign.

Throughout the PSLRTA process, the OLRB will send the employer notices that must be posted in the workplace so that affected workers know what is happening.

## The PSLRTA campaign

As soon as you become aware of a merger, amalgamation or restructuring, contact your CUPE National Staff Representative to let them know.

CUPE’s Organizing Department has a checklist of information that needs to be provided as quickly as possible to the National Representative, the sector coordinator and researcher, and to Organizing. Information is vital to a successful PSLRTA Campaign. So is a strong local union. This is important at all times, but especially so in the lead up to a representation vote. Communicate regularly with your membership, respond quickly to questions or concerns and hold events to build strong social cohesion among your members.

The OLRB will, in consultation with the employer and affected unions, decide the length of time for the representation campaign and how the unions may access employees, including through home addresses, email lists, meetings in the workplace or space on bulletin boards.

## Accessing workers in other unions/workplaces

If you have a strong, happy membership, you’re starting from a position of strength.

But you may also need to win the votes of workers currently in other unions. In that case, your National Representative can work with you and the Organizing Department on a campaign strategy.

Choosing a union to represent you in the workplace is extremely important. That's why CUPE has dedicated staff and member organizers to work with you through every step of the PSLRTA process.

## What is the voting process?

The Ontario Labour Relations Board administers the entire process. The process is very similar to that used in other certification or representation votes, in that:

- The vote is conducted by secret ballot. Neither your employer nor any union will ever know how you voted
- The vote typically takes place at the workplace during business hours
- The winning union must receive a majority of the votes
- If no ballot option receives more than 50 percent of the votes, there could be a run-off vote with the option that came in last being dropped from the ballot
- There are no advance polls
- There are no proxy votes
- While your employer and the affected unions may have a scrutineer present during the vote and the count, they may not interfere in the process or attempt to threaten or intimidate voters in any way
- If your eligibility to vote is challenged, your vote will be segregated. It will be sealed in a blank envelope within another envelope identifying it as yours. If the OLRB finds that you are entitled to vote, the blank envelope will be taken out and added to the ballots. Nobody will ever know how you voted
- If a large proportion of the ballots are challenged, the OLRB could decide not to count ballots until they can resolve the eligibility issues


# Life after the vote

## What happens to my CA?

During the vote process, employees covered by a collective agreement continue to be covered by that collective agreement. Rates of pay, benefits and working conditions continue to apply as they did prior to the vote. That’s the law.

When two or more unions represent employees before the representation vote, the collective agreements from these unions form a composite collective agreement after the vote. Under the composite collective agreement employees will continue to have the same rights they had under their collective agreement before the vote, with one key difference.

All employees, from all unions involved, will be covered by the successful union’s seniority, grievance procedure, job posting, layoff and recall language.

The composite collective agreement, along with the successful union’s seniority and grievance provisions, remain in effect until a new first collective agreement is negotiated between the employer and the successful union. CUPE has a great track record of negotiating the best language from each union’s collective agreement into the new collective agreement as well as harmonizing wages to the highest rates.

Your seniority will still count. Seniority lists from the pre-merger bargaining units will be “dovetailed.” This means the seniority of all employees will be based on a common definition of seniority and applied equally to everyone in the bargaining unit.

## What can you expect from CUPE?
