Hospital workers have seen more than our share of change in the workplace. In fact hospital mergers similar to the one between the Kingston General Hospital (KGH) and the Hotel Dieu Hospital are currently happening in several Ontario communities.

Throughout this transition period CUPE 1974 continues to actively address provincial hospital funding shortfalls and cuts to services and staff. In addition to our public and community efforts to defend hospital care and services, we are also using tools available to us through existing labour relations laws that cover restructuring, mergers and integrations in the public sector.

Specifically, CUPE has made an application under the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act (PSLRTA). This process is just starting to get underway.

Eventually under this process we will need to make a decision as to which union will represent us – the front line staff at the former KGH (members of CUPE 1974) and Hotel Dieu (currently OPSEU members) at Kingston Health Sciences Centre. This is called a union repre­sentation vote. In this vote coming sometime in the fall, you will be given the choice to continue to have CUPE to represent you in the workplace and bargain on your behalf.

Under this kind of merger, your rights, working conditions and collective agreements remain in place until the new bargaining unit configuration is determined by the Ontario Labour Relations Board. We can then begin the process of nego­tiating a first collective agreement with the new merged hospital employer.

### CUPE bargaining sets the lead for all hospital service, RPN, and clerical workers in Ontario.

CUPE members know that CUPE negotiates to maintain superior protections and improve working conditions in the hospital sector. Without doubt CUPE is the union best suited to represent workers in health care.

CUPE bargaining sets the lead for all hospital service, RPN, and clerical workers in Ontario. Comparing our collective agreements to other unions bears this out. CUPE has superior language on seniority rights, job security, layoffs and recall, and health and safety to name but a few issues. This is true here at KGH and across the province.

CUPE’s structure also gives us the greatest bargaining and political strength of any union in health care. CUPE’s Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU) has made tremendous gains for workers through its centralized bargaining process. OCHU is also the leader in promoting quality care for hospital patients and public provision of health care services in hospitals in Ontario, and is always at the forefront in the fight against hospital cuts and closures.

CUPE 1974 has a long history of fighting for members and working to better the lives of service recipients. We have helped set the lead pattern for all hospital workers in Ontario through central bargaining with OCHU. CUPE represents members at over 60 Ontario hospitals including here in Kingston. OCHU has consistently cam­paigned for better provincial funding for hospitals to stop the severe cuts to care, staff and services we’ve experienced for the last 8 years..

CUPE’s commitment to our members, our com­munities, and high standards of services for health care recipients is unequalled. When the time comes to have a representation vote we know that CUPE is the right choice for all employees at the Kingston Health Sciences Centre.

Here is some more information about the union representation process you may find useful:

- On Monday, May 1 2017, CUPE led an application to have the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act (PSLRTA) apply to the restructuring (hospital merger) that has taken place between Kingston General Hospital and Hotel Dieu Hospital.
- PSLRTA sets out rules to be followed when mergers or restructuring in the health care sector result in a workplace in which two or more unions represent workers with similar jobs.
- Essentially PSLRTA provides a process for determining which union will represent workers after mergers and restructuring happen. In the case of KHC, restructuring has meant that CUPE and OPSEU represent workers in similar job classifications. There are also some non-­union staff employed at KHSC.
- As of right now our bargaining units remain the same, and our collective agreements remain unchanged.
- We will engage in discussions with the other union and the employer to determine what a new bargaining unit (or new bargaining units) should be.
- In the event that we cannot reach agreement on the appropriate scope of the new bargaining unit (s), we will need to make formal submissions to the Ontario Labour Relations Board, and the Board will make the determination.
- After the scope of the bargaining units is determined there will likely be a representation vote to determine which union, CUPE or OPSEU will hold bargaining rights.
