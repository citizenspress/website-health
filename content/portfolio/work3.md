<img src="/img/portfolio/cupe-all.jpg" alt="CUPE" style="width: 100%;"/>



CUPE is [Canada's largest union](https://cupe.ca/about-us) with over 639,000 members. CUPE has an excellent track record of negotiating strong collective agreements, and of protecting and making gains at the bargaining table.


CUPE is Ontario's largest union with 250,000 members, including more than 75,000 CUPE members working in health care. 40,000 of those members work at 120 sites of more than 60 hospitals.

We represent registered practical nurses, personal support workers and porters, dietary, cleaning, reprocessing, trades, clerical staff, paramedics and paramedical staff.

CUPE's [Ontario Council of Hospital Unions](http://ochu.on.ca) negotiates a province-wide collective agreement with the Ontario Hospital Association and the strongest collective agreement in health care in Canada.

> Because we have the strongest collective agreement in the province - and because we enforce it - CUPE hospital locals have the lowest rate of layoff in Ontario.



We are the only hospital union in Ontario with chain bumping. You can bump anyone whose job you can do who is junior to you and the person you bump has the same rights and so on.
CUPE is the only union in the hospital sector where the senior applicant able to meet the normal requirements, gets the job posting she applies for.

No member can be laid off because her work has been contracted out. 



We have five months’ notice of layoff or five months’ pay.
CUPE's job security and seniority provisions are the strongest of any hospital union in Ontario.
CUPE is a democratic union. Our members at the workplace make the decisions around bargaining priorities, grievances, arbitrations and dues. As a member, your vote has real strength.

> CUPE proudly advocates and campaigns to protect public health care.

## Ontario Council of Hospital Unions

Founded in 1982, the 34,000 member [**Ontario Council of Hospital Unions**](http://ochu.on.ca) (OCHU/CUPE) is the hospital division of the 640,000 member Canadian Union of Public Employees.

OCHU/CUPE bargains a provincial collective agreement with the Ontario Hospital Association and lays that pattern down across the hospital sector and for those long-term care facilities which have a relationship with a hospital.

OCHU/CUPE carries out advocacy on behalf of our members and on behalf of hospital patients and long-term care residents across Ontario.

OCHU/CUPE is an active partner with the Ontario Healthcare Coalition and works closely with the Ontario Healthcare Coalition whenever community health services are threatened with cuts or privatization.






## Democratic union

As a strong and [democratic union](https://cupe.ca/governance), CUPE is committed to improving the quality of life for workers in Canada. CUPE is committed to Local Autonomy where workers democratically decide bargaining priorities and action. Women and men working together to form local unions built CUPE. They did so to have a stronger voice – a collective voice – in their workplace and in society as a whole.

## Campaigns

CUPE advocates for workers who deliver services people depend on. Our members work in hospitals, schools, municipalities, and many other public and private workplaces. We help our members provide the highest level of service by ensuring they are safe and healthy at work, and that they get fair pay and benefits for the services they provide. [We have made Canada a better place](https://cupe.ca/campaigns) for millions of workers and their families.
