Hospital workers have seen more than our share of change in the workplace. Hospital mergers similar to the one between the Rouge Valley Health System and the Lakeridge Health System are happening in several Ontario communities. While there will be many workplace and organizational transitions, the merger also brings changes at the local CUPE union and bargaining unit level.

### CUPE 6364



For one, we have a new CUPE local union to reflect the reality of a new merged hospital. The new us is CUPE 6364. We think you’ll like the simplicity of the backstory to our new local number. What better way to capture the coming together of our two local unions than by adding our respective CUPE local numbers together.

> CUPE 1999 + CUPE 4365 = CUPE 6364

CUPE National approved the merger of our two locals mid-January 2017. We will soon be receiving our new charter and we are looking forward to a future as a strong activist CUPE local.

### What happens next?

For now, although we are one local (CUPE 6364), we are still five separate bargaining units. As a CUPE member you know that CUPE negotiates to maintain superior protections and improve working conditions in the hospital sector. Under this kind of merger, your rights, working conditions and collective agreements remain in place until the new bargaining unit configuration is determined by the Ontario Labour Relations Board. We can then begin the process of negotiating a first collective agreement with the new merged hospital employer.

Our interim bylaws, approved by the CUPE National president’s office are available to members. 

As more information about the hospital merger becomes available, we will update the CUPE 6364 membership.
