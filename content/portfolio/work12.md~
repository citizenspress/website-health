When hospitals merge, workers who are union members have a huge advantage over non-union workers. Union members are protected by a collective agreement that offers superior protection against layoffs. If your employer is considering a merger with other hospitals, you should seriously consider joining a union that will fight for your rights.

### Will there be layoffs?

Ontario began merging hospitals in order to cut staff. While there may be few, if any, job cuts in nursing or support staff on the floor, management will look to reduce staff anywhere they have duplicated services -- in particular, administrative and paramedical roles.

That could mean one lab doing certain work that is now handled by multiple labs in different hospitals, or cetralizing services like records management or payroll.

### Why is it an advantage to be in a union?

There are lots of good reasons to join a union:

- workplace fairness 
- support dealing with management 
- superior health
- safety provisions

But during a merger, unionized employees have certain rights that non-union workers do not.

These include: 

- collective agreement 
- seniority rights 
- protection and recall language.

When it comes to a merger, if there are layoffs, the non-union workers wonâ€™t have those protections. The best way to improve job security is to join a union.
