### [1. Kingston General Hospital and Hotel Dieu Hospital](/mergers/kghd/)
- On April 1, 2017, Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC) began operating as a new “integrated” hospital.

### [2. Lakeridge Health and Rouge Valley Health Systems](/mergers/rvlh/)
- Hospital mergers similar to the one between the Rouge Valley Health System and the Lakeridge Health System are happening in several Ontario communities. While there will be many workplace and organizational transitions, the merger also brings changes at the local CUPE union and bargaining unit level.

### [3. The Scarborough Hospital and Rouge Valley Health System](/mergers/rvsh/)

- Rouge Valley Health System and the Scarborough Hospital are merging. While there will be many workplace and organizational transitions, the merger also brings changes at the local CUPE union and bargaining unit level.
For one, we have a new CUPE local union to reflect the reality of a new merged hospital. The new us is CUPE 5852.



### [4. St. Joseph’s Health Centre Toronto, Providence Healthcare, and St. Michael’s Hospital](/mergers/sjsmp/)

- CUPE Local 1590 has represented employees at Providence Healthcare since 1973. Since then the Local has expanded to include employees of DTZ who also work at Providence Healthcare as well as employees at Hazelton Retirement Residence. Currently the membership includes 700 fulltime, part time and casual workers.
