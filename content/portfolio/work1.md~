## We are the largest health care union in Canada

Our nearly 148,000 [health care members](https://cupe.ca/sector-profile-health-care) work in: hospitals, residential/long-term care (LTC), community health, home care, and at Canadian Blood Services (CBS).

The Ontario Council of Hospital Unions [OCHU](www.ochu.on.ca/nursing.html) is the hospital division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees in Ontario.  Our 34.000 members working in hospitals in 70 local unions at 120 facilities bargain a central collective agreement with the Ontario Hospital Association and [co-ordinate bargaining](http://www.ochu.on.ca/bargaining-conference.html) across the hospital and long term care sectors.


OCHU/CUPE engages in membership driven campaigns and government lobbying on issues that are a priority for our members such as [violence at work,](https://youtu.be/MPpGzlafYGQ), increased funding and reduce deaths due to hospital acquired infections and OCHU is actively involved in patient and resident advocacy in many communities.


Across Canada CUPE represents health care workers in every province, with the largest numbers in Ontario ([Ontario Council of Hospital Unions - OCHU](http://www.ochu.on.ca/nursing.html)) British Columbia (Hospital Employees’ Union members), and Saskatchewan. 


While CUPE Locals and Provincial health care divisions bargain strong collective agreements and champion provincial health care issues, CUPE National, as Canada's [largest health care union,](https://cupe.ca/health-care) lobbies on issues that impact health care workers across Canada such as the privatization of health care and increased funding.  Our strength and [success](https://cupe.ca/national-health-care-issues-committee) in one part of the country benefits our members across Canada.

## Together we are stronger.
