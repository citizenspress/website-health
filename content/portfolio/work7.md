Ontario’s hospital sector is undergoing a sustained period of change. Service integrations, restructuring and hospital mergers, like the one involving St. Joseph's Heath Centre (Toronto), St. Michael's Hospital and Providence Healthcare are happening in several Ontario communities. The three hospitals submitted a joint voluntary integration (merger) proposal in April 2017.

### How will the merger affect you and your CUPE 1144 collective agreement?


When the Ontario provincial government began to downsize public services through mergers and amalgamations in the municipal, school board, and hospital sectors in 1997, it passed the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act (PSLRTA) to deal with a variety of labour relations and union representation issues. PSLRTA also establishes certain rights for affected workers undergoing hospital mergers like at St. Jospeh's Health Centre.


### What happens to your CUPE 1144 collective agreement during and after the PSLRTA process?

During the vote process, you are covered by your existing collective agreement.

> ***Wages and benefits will not be reduced as a result of the representation vote. That’s the law.***

Immediately after the vote, most of the provisions of your CUPE collective agreement continue to apply under a “composite agreement,” which will also include provisions from the other union’s collective agreement that affect their former members.

However, the winning union’s collective agreement language dealing with seniority, grievance procedure, job posting, layoff, and recall will apply to everyone.


### Together we are stronger.

Choosing a union to represent you in the workplace is extremely important.

At CUPE, we have dedicated staff and member-organizers to be there for you, through every step of the PSLRTA process.



### CUPE has proven we can win hospital PSLRTA votes.

To do that, it takes every CUPE 1144 member at St. Joseph's Health Centre getting involved and talking about what makes CUPE the best choice to continue to represent you and your co- workers at the new merged hospital.


# Public Services Labour Relations Transition Act (PSLRTA)


### How does PSLRTA apply?

When hospital workplaces covered by PSLRTA amalgamate, merge or restructure, the Ontario Labour Relations Board (OLRB) will, in consultation with the affected unions and employers, determine what bargaining units are appropriate in the new workplace. This process is just starting to get underway. CUPE 1144 will provide our members with information as full hospital integration process develops.


Should one union represent more than 80 percent of workers in the post-merger bar- gaining unit, the OLRB may simply declare that union to be the bargaining agent without a vote. Otherwise, all hospital employees who would become members of the new bargaining unit are eligible to vote on which union they want to represent them at the new merged hospital.



If there are multiple unions and a “no union” option on the ballot, which may be the case in this particular hospital merger and no option achieves a majority of the votes, the option with the least number of votes will be dropped and a run-off vote will be conducted. There will only be a “no union” option on the ballot if more than 40 percent of the appropriate bargaining unit were non-union prior to the merger.

### The Vote

- There is a secret ballot vote conducted by the OLRB.
- Neither the employer nor the union(s) may interfere in the process or attempt to threaten or intimidate voters.
- The vote is typically done at the hospital at a time covering most shifts.
- There are no advance polls.
- There are no proxy votes.
- The winning union must receive a majority of the votes.

### What happens during the workplace representation process under PSLRTA?

During this time, one step is a meeting with the Ontario Labour Relations Board between CUPE, the hospital employer and other unions in the workplaces to determine the appropriate bargaining units and the ground rules for the representation vote.

Issues such as the length of time for the representation campaign and how the unions may access employees, including through home addresses, email lists, meetings in the workplace or space on bulletin boards, are all agreed to in advance.
