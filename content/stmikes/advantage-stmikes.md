+++

Hospital workers who are CUPE members have a huge advantage over non-union workers because CUPE members are protected by a strong Collective Agreement.

When you join a Union you negotiate a Collective Agreement that sets out such things as:

- Vacation Entitlement (unreduced percentage in lieu or time off, increased with length of service);
- Rates of Pay and regular procession through pay grids;
- Fair Shift Scheduling Process & schedules posted in advance;
- Job Security Language including due to technological change;
- Layoff & Recall Rights;
- Health & Safety; and
- Discipline & Termination for Just Cause only

When you have a Collective Agreement the employer must abide by the rights and benefits set out in the Contract and must follow any and all procedures set out there as well. These working conditions are not restrictive for employees, however putting working conditions into the Collective Agreement definitely restricts the employer. They can no longer treat employees whatever way they wish. It ensures that everyone receives the same treatment by the employer and if not, it provides a process (the grievance process) to correct the problems.

When you join a union everyone knows what the process is for dealing with most workplace matters because it is set out in the Collective Agreement.
