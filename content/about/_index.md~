## Ontario Council of Hospital Unions

Founded in 1982, the 34,000 member Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU) is the hospital division of Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE).

OCHU/CUPE bargains a provincial collective agreement with the Ontario Hospital Association and lays that pattern down across the hospital sector and for those long-term care facilities that have a relationship with a hospital. Because we have the strongest collective agreement in the province - and because we enforce it - OCHU/CUPE hospital locals have the lowest rate of layoff in Ontario.

OCHU/CUPE carries out advocacy on behalf of our members and on behalf of hospital patients and long-term care residents across Ontario. OCHU/CUPE is an active partner with the Ontario Healthcare Coalition and works closely with the Ontario Healthcare Coalition whenever community health services are threatened with cuts or privatization.

## Democratic union

CUPE is a democratic union committed to Local Autonomy. This means that local bargaining units make decisions about bargaining priorities, grievances and arbitrations and even dues. In other words, as a member, your vote has real strength.

## Campaigns

In addition to securing improvements to working conditions at the bargaining table, CUPE also mobilizes public pressure on government decision-makers to enhance and protect public health care. CUPE members run effective advocacy campaigns on a number of healthcare issues, including: increased staffing in the public health care system, an end to health care cuts and privatization, legislative protection against violence in the workplace, a reduction in deaths due to hospital acquired infections, the implementation of a national pharmacare program.
