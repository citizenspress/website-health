#### The Ontario Labour Relations Act  (OLRA)

In Ontario the OLRA protects the rights of  workers to join a Union. Sections 70 and  72 of the OLRA prohibit employers from  interfering with an employee’s right to  join a union and ensures that employees  are free from coercion, intimidation,  threats, promises or undue influence,  including reprisals for their support and  involvement with the union. If the  employer violates those rights CUPE will  file an Unfair Labour Practice application  with the Labour Board.

#### Signing a CUPE membership card

In order to join CUPE you must complete,  sign and date a CUPE membership card.  Once you have completed it, mail it in to  the postage paid envelope or drop it off  with one of our Organizers. Signing a  membership card is a requirement under  the Ontario Labour Relations Act.  Once CUPE has received cards from at  least 50% of the non union employees  then CUPE will file an Application for  Certification. When CUPE files the  Application the membership cards are  sent to the Ontario Labour Relations  Board (OLRB) with the Application.

> The cards are completely confidential  and the employer will never know  who signed a card. 

#### The Vote

When CUPE files the Application for  Certification the Employer is served  with a copy of the Application (not the  membership cards). Five business days  following the filing of the Application an  Officer from the OLRB comes out to  the workplace and holds a secret  ballot vote.

> No one will ever know  how you voted. 

The vote is what determines whether  CUPE is successful or not. It is a simple  majority vote, so if 500 people come out  to vote and 251 vote in favour of joining  the union then everyone will become  part of the union. Signing the CUPE  membership card is the first step in  joining CUPE but it is important to  remember that the vote is what  determines whether CUPE is successful.

#### Freeze Provision

The OLRA also has a 'freeze' provision  which means that your working  conditions are frozen from the date the  application is filed until you have your  1st Collective Agreement. This  prevents employers from reducing  wages and working conditions as a  'punishment' for joining the union. The  employer is forced to carry on business  as usual.
