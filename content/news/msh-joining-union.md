Often during an union organizing drive workers and the employer will focus primarily on monetary issues.

Employers will often scare workers into believing that they will take home less as a result of paying union dues.

The fact is that unionized workers earn more than non union workers. That is one of the reasons why employers don't want a union in the workplace. The other reason they don't want a union is because they lose the absolute control they currently have.
