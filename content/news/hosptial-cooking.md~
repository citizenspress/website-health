St. Joseph’s Health Centre is in the process of making a decision about how to prepare and deliver food in its cafeteria.

Rather than serve “TV dinner” style food from a factory operation outside of Toronto, we think the hospital should consider patient well-being and the needs of the community.

## We are calling on St. Joseph’s to:
- Serve food that is cooked in-house
- Use good quality, fresh ingredients
- Use locally sourced, organic food when possible
- Focus on patient well-being, not cutting corners

## There is a local food solution

Parkdale is already home to a local food movement. There are plenty of food options that are better for patients and better for the community.

We think St. Joe’s should lead by example by developing a local patient food solution. Help us stop St. Joe’s from making a bad decision.

Tell the hospital board we want fresh, local patient food cooked in the hospital kitchen.
