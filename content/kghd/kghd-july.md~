## CUPE Local 1974 Newsletter

### Wage harmonization will follow merger of KGH and Hotel Dieu


With the merger of KGH and Hotel Dieu, a vote will be held to decide which union will represent staff at the new hospital.

CUPE has a much stronger contract than OPSEU does, especially in the area of job security. This will be very important because downsizing follows hospital mergers.

Once the staff have decided which union will represent them, negotiations begin to deal with any differences in rates of pay that may exist between workers at the different hospital sites who are doing the same work.

In every merger that CUPE has been involved in, CUPE has succeeded in raising all rates of pay to the highest level. We will certainly do the same in Kingston with your continued support.

In solidarity,

**Mike Rodrigues  
President

### Central bargaining begins for CUPE hospital staff

Bargaining has begun for the clerical staff represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees. It started June 10 and continues in August and September.

The priorities for the union in this round of bargaining include:

- Job security
- Safe working conditions
- Wages, benefit improvements and premium increases



In bargaining the hospitals are seeking a number of concessions to job security, benefit and in other areas. CUPE is committed to continuing our long standing history of no concessions in our bargaining with the hospitals.

All hospital staff represented by CUPE will be invited to participate in a teleconference call on July 24th at 7:00 p.m. to discuss the bargaining.

We will call you at home.

A newsletter will be direct mailed to every memberâ€™s home in August to update you on the status of the talks.

CUPE is the only union in the hospital sector that did not bargain a wage freeze for its members.

> "The CUPE central hospital bargaining team is confident that this contract can be negotiated with wage gains, benefit and premium improvements and with improvements in other areas."

### The problem of violence against hospital staff

Ontario hospital workers are subject to a higher rate of workplace violence than policing or corrections.

Some of the violence is so severe that the staff member who is assaulted will never work again.

CUPE conducted focus groups on violence at hospitals and long term care facilities across Ontario in 2016 and 2017, in conjunction with the University of Stirling. The findings will be published in an international journal of occupational health and safety this fall.


CUPE is bargaining for new protections for hospital staff in our central bargaining this summer.

CUPE and Unifor called in May for the federal government to introduce amendments to the federal criminal code to make assaulting hospital staff a more serious criminal offence.
