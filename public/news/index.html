            <p>
    <img src="/img/news/violence-video.png"  align="right" width="40%">
	      CUPE/OCHU&#39;s anti-violence campaign received extensive media coverage. The media reported on the polling and stories of physical attacks, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, violence in Ontario hospitals. Every day, frontline caregivers are suffering serious injuries that lead to time off work and even post-traumatic stress disorder. Instead of protecting their staff, hospital managers discourage them from reporting incidents and have even fired a nurse for revealing the real epidemic of violence in healthcare.

            <p>
    <img src="/img/news/sound.png"  align="right" width="40%">
	      CUPE represents about 20,000 registered practical nurses (RPNs) in Ontario. That’s more than any other union. CUPE bargaining sets the lead for all hospital service, RPN, and clerical workers in Ontario. Comparing our collective agreements to other unions bears this out. CUPE has superior language on seniority rights, job security, layoffs and recall, and health and safety to name but a few issues. This is true at Kingston General Hospital and at hospitals across the province.

    <img src="/img/news/mike.jpg"  align="right" width="40%">
	      More than 150 hospital staff from Kingston Health Sciences Centre KHSC), represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE 1974) will board several buses early Friday (October 27, 2017) morning and head to Ottawa. There, they will join hundreds of other hospital workers from across Ontario, for a noon rally at Ottawa’s Montfort Hospital, calling for better provincial funding for hospitals. The Ottawa rally is organized by the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU/CUPE), CUPE’s hospital division in Ontario.

            <p>
    <img src="/img/news/violence-stats.png"  align="right" width="40%">
	      A small investment in a Plexiglass barrier would have prevented a patient from stabbing a Perth/Smiths Falls hospital admitting clerk in the neck. Better alarms would have enabled nurses at Hamilton&#39;s St. Joseph&#39;s Health Centre to summon help when a patient, asked to take his medication, became violent. A nurse at a Royal Ottawa site was stabbed repeatedly by a previously violent patient and the hospital fined earlier this summer for failing to &#34;reassess the risk of workplace violence&#34; as required by the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

	      St. Joseph’s Health Centre is in the process of making a decision about how to prepare and deliver food in its cafeteria. Rather than serve TV dinner style food from a factory operation outside of Toronto, we think the hospital should consider patient well-being and the needs of the community.

            <p>
    <img src=""  align="right" width="40%">
	      KINGSTON, ON — Below average provincial funding of about 1.4 per cent for the newly amalgamated Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC) in 2017, “is bad news for patient care and cause for alarm at a time of significant change,” said Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) 1974 president Mike Rodrigues at a media conference today.

            <p>
    <img src=""  align="right" width="40%">
	      A good employer will respect your right  to make an informed decision about whether joining CUPE is the right choice  for you and your colleagues. However, it&#39;s not unusual for employers  to be afraid that you will join the Union so  they resort to using union busting companies or the tactics promoted by  those companies.

           <h2 id="posttitle">Your right to join a union is protected by law in Ontario.</h2>
            <p>
    <img src=""  align="right" width="40%">
	      In Ontario the OLRA protects the rights of  workers to join a Union. Sections 70 and  72 of the OLRA prohibit employers from  interfering with an employee’s right to  join a union and ensures that employees  are free from coercion, intimidation,  threats, promises or undue influence,  including reprisals for their support and  involvement with the union. If the  employer violates those rights CUPE will  file an Unfair Labour Practice application  with the Labour Board.
