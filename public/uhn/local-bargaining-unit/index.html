        <h1>Locals &amp; Bargaining units: What is the difference?</h1>
        

<p>When you are thinking about joining a union there are can be confusion around what the process is and understanding union structure.  Included in this is the difference between a ‘bargaining unit’ and a ‘local’.</p>

<h2 id="bargaining-unit">Bargaining Unit</h2>

<p>If a new group of employees decides to join a union they are ‘certified’ under the Ontario Labour Relations Act (OLRA) as a ‘bargaining unit’ of unionized employees.  Under the OLRA a Collective Agreement must be negotiated for each new certified bargaining unit of employees. It does not cover non-union employees or members of any other bargaining unit with the same employer.  This means that as a newly unionized group with CUPE you would have your own Collective Agreement that only you and your colleagues would negotiate and vote on.</p>

<p>You could not become part of any already existing bargaining unit at UHN unless the employer agreed to do so and the members of the existing bargaining unit and your newly certified unit each voted in favour of doing so.</p>

<h2 id="local">Local</h2>

<p>A Local is part of the internal union structure.   A Local may have one or more ‘bargaining units’ of employees within it.  Even if a bargaining unit joins a local with other bargaining units the Collective Agreement for each bargaining remains in place with only the members of that bargaining unit having control of their Agreement.</p>

<p>Often bargaining units of employees will decide to join the same Local so they can pool their resources, knowledge and support.  For instance, you will often see a Hospital Local with a bargaining unit of full-time employees and a bargaining unit of part-time employees.  For these groups it makes sense to work collaboratively on issues in the workplace and to coordinate their bargaining etc.</p>

<p>However, because CUPE is based on Local Autonomy there is no requirement for any bargaining unit to join an existing local and often newly certified employees decide to have their own Local.</p>

<h2 id="what-would-a-new-bargaining-unit-at-uhn-look-like">What would a new bargaining unit at UHN look like?</h2>

<p>As you may know there are two CUPE Locals within UHN.  Local 5001 at Toronto Western and Local 1156 at TRI. Both these locals existed prior to the merger and creation of UHN.  Within those locals there are ‘bargaining units’ of employees, each with their own Collective Agreements.  To date both these locals have continued as they were prior to the merger and because of local autonomy any decision to merge the two locals would be completely up to members within those two locals.</p>

<p>If you and your colleagues decide to join CUPE you would also enjoy the same benefits of local autonomy.  After a successful vote you and your colleagues will be invited to a membership meeting where you will either decide to join an already existing CUPE Local or, form your own Local and elect your own Local leadership. Whichever you choose, you will also elect members who will sit on your bargaining committee and work with a CUPE National Representative to negotiate your first Collective Agreement.  Your committee will work with the CUPE Representative to survey and work with the membership to identify the priorities of the group to ensure your bargaining proposals reflect the wishes of the members.  When a settlement has been reached the bargaining committee will bring the settlement back to you and your colleagues for ratification.</p>

<h2 id="seniority">Seniority</h2>

<p>As non-union employees you only have service with the employer, not seniority and in most cases your service is only used to determine vacation entitlement.  In a non-union workplace the employer does not have to recognize your length of service if they do not wish to.</p>

<p>Seniority recognizes that employees should receive consideration for the length of time they have worked for their employer.  In most collective agreements, seniority is determined from the date of original hiring with the employer.  Sometimes bargaining units decide on other ways to calculate seniority which is often the case for part-time employees.  You and your colleagues will determine what makes the most sense for your bargaining unit but be assured you will not lose your years of service as a result of joining the union.</p>

<p>One of the main purposes of seniority is to provide a fair and objective way of determining who should be entitled to a promotion when a job becomes vacant.  Provided both employees are qualified for the job, it makes sense that the employee who has spent longer with the employer should be entitled to preference over a less senior employee.  Seniority is also often used to determine job security, lay off and recall, bumping and vacation scheduling.</p>

<p>Without this kind of objective determination, the employer has a free hand to choose whomever it wants and can choose whomever it likes better, without any consideration of their relative abilities and length of employment.</p>
