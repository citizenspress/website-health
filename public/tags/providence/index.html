    <p>When hospitals merge, workers who are union members have a huge advantage over non-union workers. Union members are protected by a collective agreement that offers superior protection against layoffs. If your employer is considering a merger with other hospitals, you should seriously consider joining a union that will fight for your rights.</p>

    <h4><a href="/mergers/articles/harmonization/">Harmonization: What is the process?</a></h4>
    What is Harmonization? Harmonization is the process of taking the Collective Agreements from all the union’s involved in the merger, along with any non union working conditions, and merging them into the new ‘first’ Collective Agreement.
Some employers see a merger as an opportunity to table concessions to Collective Agreements or non union working conditions but CUPE negotiates to maintain superior conditions and believes that you should not lose hard won rights and benefits due to a merger.

    As you know the employer recently put out a notice letting employees know that all employees can apply for jobs at all sites within the newly merger Hospital and this has raised a number of questions by our members. Over the last couple of weeks CUPE has met with the employer at both Providence and St. Joseph’s.
What should I do if I hold a position at more than one location?
