      <description>Hospital workers who are CUPE members have a huge advantage over non-union workers because CUPE members are protected by a strong Collective Agreement.
When you join a Union you negotiate a Collective Agreement that sets out such things as:
 Vacation Entitlement (unreduced percentage in lieu or time off, increased with length of service); Rates of Pay and regular procession through pay grids; Fair Shift Scheduling Process &amp;amp; schedules posted in advance; Job Security Language including due to technological change; Layoff &amp;amp; Recall Rights; Health &amp;amp; Safety; and Discipline &amp;amp; Termination for Just Cause only  When you have a Collective Agreement the employer must abide by the rights and benefits set out in the Contract and must follow any and all procedures set out there as well.</description>

      <description>CUPE Local 1974 Newsletter Wage harmonization will follow merger of KGH and Hotel Dieu With the merger of KGH and Hotel Dieu, a vote will be held to decide which union will represent staff at the new hospital.
CUPE has a much stronger contract than OPSEU does, especially in the area of job security. This will be very important because downsizing follows hospital mergers.
Once the staff have decided which union will represent them, negotiations begin to deal with any differences in rates of pay that may exist between workers at the different hospital sites who are doing the same work.</description>

      <description>Technological changes pose particular issues for clerical staff  Digitization of medical records Automation of dicta-typing and medical transcription Electronic patient registration kiosks  These are just some examples of the revolution through technological change taking place in hospitals across Ontario, which is eliminating the jobs of clerical employees.
In our central bargaining with Ontario hospitals, CUPE is seeking increased protections against the impact of technological changes on clerical staff.</description>

      <description>Nursing Graduate Guarantee Programme Changes Changes made to the Nursing Graduate Guarantee Programme in April concern CUPE because it more strongly encourages the hiring into full-time positions of nurses who have just graduated from community college.
Many RPNs work part-time for years waiting to acquire the seniority to post successfully into a full-time position with benefits.
Th real problem the Ministry of Health needs to address are the budget cuts to Ontario Hospitals.</description>

      <description>The problem of violence against care staff Ontario healthcare workers are subject to a higher rate of workplace violence than policing or corrections.
Some of the violence is so severe that the staff member who is assaulted will never work again.
CUPE conducted focus groups on violence at hospitals and long term care facilities across Ontario in 2016 and 2017, in conjunction with the University of Stirling. The findings will be published in an international journal of occupational health and safety this fall.</description>
