      <description>Dear CUPE supporter, We’ve heard from many of you about the misinformation and confusion spread by HR in a series of “info sessions” held last week. We would like to restore some facts into the discussion:
 CUPE absolutely can and will protect against layoffs. Our hospital collective agreements have the strongest job security provisions in the industry. CUPE members are entitled to: 5 months notice in advance of layoffs, retraining for other positions within the hospital, bumping rights, recall rights from a layoff to an available opening and layoff benefits and separation allowances.</description>

      <description>Podcast explaining the effect of the merger process at St. Mike&amp;rsquo;s on non-union clerical.
Listen to the podcast here.

Hello CUPE supporters!
As you may be aware, there has been a merger between Providence, St. Joseph’s and St. Michael’s hospitals as of August 1, 2017.
With any public sector merger such as this, there are government regulations that guide the process. When merging workplaces with many unions, there must be a vote by the workers to select a single union to represent the newly merged workplace.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Ontario hospitals don&amp;rsquo;t want you to know that violence against hospital staff is real and rampant,&amp;rdquo; says union taking public awareness campaign to radio today
 Media Release
October 17, 2017
TORONTO, ON - A small investment in a Plexiglass barrier would have prevented a patient from stabbing a Perth/Smiths Falls hospital admitting clerk in the neck. Better alarms would have enabled nurses at Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s St. Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Health Centre to summon help when a patient, asked to take his medication, became violent.</description>
