    <h4><a href="/stmikes/advantage-stmikes/">Why is it an advantage to be in a Union?</a></h4>
    Hospital workers who are CUPE members have a huge advantage over non-union workers because CUPE members are protected by a strong Collective Agreement.
When you join a Union you negotiate a Collective Agreement that sets out such things as:
 Vacation Entitlement (unreduced percentage in lieu or time off, increased with length of service); Rates of Pay and regular procession through pay grids; Fair Shift Scheduling Process &amp; schedules posted in advance; Job Security Language including due to technological change; Layoff &amp; Recall Rights; Health &amp; Safety; and Discipline &amp; Termination for Just Cause only  When you have a Collective Agreement the employer must abide by the rights and benefits set out in the Contract and must follow any and all procedures set out there as well.
