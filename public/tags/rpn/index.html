    <h4><a href="/news/union-rights-2016-01-01/">Your right to join a union is protected by law in Ontario.</a></h4>
    The Ontario Labour Relations Act (OLRA) In Ontario the OLRA protects the rights of workers to join a Union. Sections 70 and 72 of the OLRA prohibit employers from interfering with an employee’s right to join a union and ensures that employees are free from coercion, intimidation, threats, promises or undue influence, including reprisals for their support and involvement with the union. If the employer violates those rights CUPE will file an Unfair Labour Practice application with the Labour Board.
