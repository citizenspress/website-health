        <h1>Rouge Valley Health System and the Scarborough Hospital</h1>
         <p>Hospital workers have seen more than our share of change in the workplace. Hospital mergers similar to the one between the Rouge Valley Health System and the Scarborough Hospital are happening in several Ontario communities.</p>

<p>While there will be many workplace and organizational transitions, the merger also brings changes at the local CUPE union and bargaining unit level.</p>

<p>For one, we have a new CUPE local union to reflect the reality of a new merged hospital.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="the-new-us-is-cupe-5852">The new us is CUPE 5852.</h3>

<p>We think you’ll like the simplicity of the backstory to our new local number. What better way to capture the coming together of our two local unions than by adding our respective CUPE local numbers together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CUPE 1487 + CUPE 4365 = CUPE 5852</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CUPE National approved the merger of our two locals January 17, 2017.</p>

<p>We will soon be receiving our new charter and we are looking forward to a future as a strong activist CUPE local.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-next">What happens next?</h3>

<p>For now, although we are one local (CUPE 5852), we are still five separate bargaining units.</p>

<p>As a CUPE member you know that CUPE negotiates to maintain superior protections and improve working conditions in the hospital sector. Under this kind of merger, your rights, working conditions and collective agreements remain in place until the new bargaining unit configuration is determined by the Ontario Labour Relations Board. We can then begin the process of negotiating a first collective agreement with the new merged hospital employer.</p>

<p>As more information about the hospital merger becomes available, we will update the CUPE 5852 membership.</p>

<p>      <img src="/img/news/sound.png"  align="right" width="40%">
  CUPE represents about 20,000 registered practical nurses (RPNs) in Ontario. That’s more than any other union. CUPE bargaining sets the lead for all hospital service, RPN, and clerical workers in Ontario. Comparing our collective agreements to other unions bears this out. CUPE has superior language on seniority rights, job security, layoffs and recall, and health and safety to name but a few issues. This is true at Kingston General Hospital and at hospitals across the province.

<p>      <img src="/img/news/mike.jpg"  align="right" width="40%">
  More than 150 hospital staff from Kingston Health Sciences Centre KHSC), represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE 1974) will board several buses early Friday (October 27, 2017) morning and head to Ottawa. There, they will join hundreds of other hospital workers from across Ontario, for a noon rally at Ottawa’s Montfort Hospital, calling for better provincial funding for hospitals. The Ottawa rally is organized by the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU/CUPE), CUPE’s hospital division in Ontario.

<p>      <img src="/img/news/violence-stats.png"  align="right" width="40%">
  A small investment in a Plexiglass barrier would have prevented a patient from stabbing a Perth/Smiths Falls hospital admitting clerk in the neck. Better alarms would have enabled nurses at Hamilton&#39;s St. Joseph&#39;s Health Centre to summon help when a patient, asked to take his medication, became violent. A nurse at a Royal Ottawa site was stabbed repeatedly by a previously violent patient and the hospital fined earlier this summer for failing to &#34;reassess the risk of workplace violence&#34; as required by the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

  St. Joseph’s Health Centre is in the process of making a decision about how to prepare and deliver food in its cafeteria. Rather than serve TV dinner style food from a factory operation outside of Toronto, we think the hospital should consider patient well-being and the needs of the community.
