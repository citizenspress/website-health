        <h1>Job Posting and Promotion Update for newly merged hospitals</h1>
         

<p>As you know the employer recently put out a notice letting employees know that all employees can apply for jobs at all sites within the newly merger Hospital and this has raised a number of questions by our members. Over the last couple of weeks CUPE has met with the employer at both Providence and St. Joseph’s.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-do-if-i-hold-a-position-at-more-than-one-location">What should I do if I hold a position at more than one location?</h2>

<p>Nothing! The employer has advised CUPE that they will not be making any changes at this time, even if you are working more than the Full time Equivalent or max hours in the collective agreement.</p>

<p>Human Resources as advised all their managers of this so no one should be advised by their manager or supervisor that they need to resign from any position. If there are to be any changes they will need to be agreed to by CUPE and the employer. What if I want to bid on a position at another location now?</p>

<p>At this time there is no agreement between CUPE and the employer or between the unions to recognize each other’s seniority. This means if you bid on a job at another site it&rsquo;s possible you will lose your seniority. Even if you go from one CUPE bargaining unit to another you could lose your seniority because there aren&rsquo;t provisions in the agreements that allow for the transfer of seniority.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-have-to-wait">Why do we have to wait?</h2>

<p>There are many, many issues that both CUPE and the employer need more information on such as implications for benefits, overtime rates, pension contributions, etc. CUPE doesn’t want anyone making a decision without having all the information available to them as this could result in irreversible problems down the road.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-the-concerns">What are some the concerns?</h2>

<p>CUPE is not agreeable to any process that violates our collective agreement and feel that it would be better to go ahead and file a PSLRTA application rather than agree to anything that or puts the job security of our members at risk. Some CUPE’s concerns are:</p>

<ol>
<li>CUPE does not agree that ‘external’ applicants (meaning from another union and/or location) will be considered over internal applicants with discipline or attendance issues;</li>
<li>CUPE does not agree that ‘external’ applicants will be considered over other CUPE applicants such as part time who already work at that location; and</li>
<li>CUPE does not agree that anyone should be forced to resign from any position regardless of whether a position is union or non union. If you experience any problems or have concerns about this process please contact your local executive immediately.</li>
</ol>

<p>      <img src="/img/news/sound.png"  align="right" width="40%">
  CUPE represents about 20,000 registered practical nurses (RPNs) in Ontario. That’s more than any other union. CUPE bargaining sets the lead for all hospital service, RPN, and clerical workers in Ontario. Comparing our collective agreements to other unions bears this out. CUPE has superior language on seniority rights, job security, layoffs and recall, and health and safety to name but a few issues. This is true at Kingston General Hospital and at hospitals across the province.

<p>      <img src="/img/news/mike.jpg"  align="right" width="40%">
  More than 150 hospital staff from Kingston Health Sciences Centre KHSC), represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE 1974) will board several buses early Friday (October 27, 2017) morning and head to Ottawa. There, they will join hundreds of other hospital workers from across Ontario, for a noon rally at Ottawa’s Montfort Hospital, calling for better provincial funding for hospitals. The Ottawa rally is organized by the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU/CUPE), CUPE’s hospital division in Ontario.

<p>      <img src="/img/news/violence-stats.png"  align="right" width="40%">
  A small investment in a Plexiglass barrier would have prevented a patient from stabbing a Perth/Smiths Falls hospital admitting clerk in the neck. Better alarms would have enabled nurses at Hamilton&#39;s St. Joseph&#39;s Health Centre to summon help when a patient, asked to take his medication, became violent. A nurse at a Royal Ottawa site was stabbed repeatedly by a previously violent patient and the hospital fined earlier this summer for failing to &#34;reassess the risk of workplace violence&#34; as required by the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

  St. Joseph’s Health Centre is in the process of making a decision about how to prepare and deliver food in its cafeteria. Rather than serve TV dinner style food from a factory operation outside of Toronto, we think the hospital should consider patient well-being and the needs of the community.
