           <h1 id="posttitle">Providence, St. Joe&#39;s, St. Mike&#39;s Hospital Merger</h1>
         <p>  Hospital workers have seen more than our share of change in the workplace. Hospital mergers similar to the one between the Providence and St. Joe&#39;s and St. Mikesare happening in several Ontario communities. While there will be many workplace and organizational transitions, the merger also brings changes at the local CUPE union and bargaining unit level.<p>

           <h1 id="posttitle">Kingston General Hospital and Hotel Dieu Hospital</h1>
         <p>  On April 1, 2017, Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC) began operating as a new “integrated” hospital. CUPE’s commitment to our members, our com­munities, and high standards of services for health care recipients is unequalled. When the time comes to have a representation vote we know that CUPE is the right choice for all employees at the Kingston Health Sciences Centre.<p>

           <h1 id="posttitle">Markham Stouffville Hospital</h1>
         <p>  CUPE Local 3651 has represented the Full time service workers at Markham Stouffville Hospital since 1994. In 2015 we became the representative of the Part time Service workers at Markham Stouffville Hospital and negotiated their first Collective Agreement. CUPE Local 3651 now represents over 450 Full and Part time workers at Markham Stouffville Hospital.<p>

           <h1 id="posttitle">What if I am non-union?</h1>
         <p>  When hospitals merge, workers who are union members have a huge advantage over non-union workers. Union members are protected by a collective agreement that offers superior protection against layoffs. If your employer is considering a merger with other hospitals, you should seriously consider joining a union that will fight for your rights.<p>

           <h1 id="posttitle">Harmonization: What is the process?</h1>
         <p>  Harmonization is the process of taking the Collective Agreements from all the union’s involved in the merger, along with any non union working conditions, and merging them into the new ‘first’ Collective Agreement.<p>

           <h1 id="posttitle">Job Posting and Promotion Update for newly merged hospitals</h1>
         <p>  As you know the employer recently put out a notice letting employees know that all employees can apply for jobs at all sites within the newly merger Hospital and this has raised a number of questions by our members.<p>
