      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hospitals are merging across Ontario. The result are run-off votes between unions in those hospitals where members choose which union will represent them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing a union to represent you in the workplace is extremely important.  CUPE Locals and Provincial health care divisions bargain strong collective agreements and champion provincial health care issues. CUPE is Canada’s largest health care union, lobbies on issues that impact health care workers across Canada such as the privatization of health care and increased funding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A percentage of not less than 40% of the employees must sign union membership cards, then an application for certification is submitted to the Ontario Labour Relations Board.  One week later the Ontario Labour Relations Board holds a secret ballot vote at your workplace.  In order for the union to be successful fifty percent plus one of the employees who cast a ballot must vote in favour of the union.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>When you are thinking about joining a union there are can be confusion around what the process is and understanding union structure. Included in this is the difference between a ‘bargaining unit’ and a ‘local’.
Bargaining Unit If a new group of employees decides to join a union they are ‘certified’ under the Ontario Labour Relations Act (OLRA) as a ‘bargaining unit’ of unionized employees. Under the OLRA a Collective Agreement must be negotiated for each new certified bargaining unit of employees.</description>

      <description>CUPE/OCHU&amp;rsquo;s anti-violence campaign Epidemic of Violence received extensive media coverage. The media reported on the polling and stories of physical attacks, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and violence in Ontario hospitals.
Every day, frontline caregivers are suffering serious injuries that lead to time off work and even post-traumatic stress disorder. Instead of protecting their staff, hospital managers discourage them from reporting incidents and have even fired a nurse for revealing the real epidemic of violence in healthcare.</description>

      <description>Podcast explaining the effect of the merger process at St. Mike&amp;rsquo;s on non-union clerical.
Listen to the podcast here.

Hello CUPE supporters!
As you may be aware, there has been a merger between Providence, St. Joseph’s and St. Michael’s hospitals as of August 1, 2017.
With any public sector merger such as this, there are government regulations that guide the process. When merging workplaces with many unions, there must be a vote by the workers to select a single union to represent the newly merged workplace.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Ontario hospitals don&amp;rsquo;t want you to know that violence against hospital staff is real and rampant,&amp;rdquo; says union taking public awareness campaign to radio today
 Media Release
October 17, 2017
TORONTO, ON - A small investment in a Plexiglass barrier would have prevented a patient from stabbing a Perth/Smiths Falls hospital admitting clerk in the neck. Better alarms would have enabled nurses at Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s St. Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Health Centre to summon help when a patient, asked to take his medication, became violent.</description>

      <description>St. Joseph’s Health Centre is in the process of making a decision about how to prepare and deliver food in its cafeteria.
Rather than serve “TV dinner” style food from a factory operation outside of Toronto, we think the hospital should consider patient well-being and the needs of the community.
We are calling on St. Joseph’s to:  Serve food that is cooked in-house Use good quality, fresh ingredients Use locally sourced, organic food when possible Focus on patient well-being, not cutting corners  There is a local food solution Parkdale is already home to a local food movement.</description>

      <description>Often during an union organizing drive workers and the employer will focus primarily on monetary issues.
Employers will often scare workers into believing that they will take home less as a result of paying union dues.
The fact is that unionized workers earn more than non union workers. That is one of the reasons why employers don&amp;rsquo;t want a union in the workplace. The other reason they don&amp;rsquo;t want a union is because they lose the absolute control they currently have.</description>

CUPE Local 3651 now represents over 450 Full and Part time workers at Markham Stouffville Hospital.
As a member of OCHU, the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, we bargain centrally, and locally, for the Collective Agreement that has the strongest job protection language in the province of Ontario.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hospital workers have seen more than our share of change in the workplace. Hospital mergers similar to the one between the Rouge Valley Health System and the Lakeridge Health System are happening in several Ontario communities. While there will be many workplace and organizational transitions, the merger also brings changes at the local CUPE union and bargaining unit level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Recently you received a letter from UHN in response to CUPE’s organizing drive. The letter you received contained some inaccuracies and outdated information. In this letter, you will find updated and accurate information regarding CUPE and unions in general.
The first issue that needs to be addressed is regarding the Ontario Liberal Government’s net zero bargaining policy. The government officially ended their net zero policy in the fall of 2016 after it began to fall apart thanks to union contract settlements.</description>

      <description>MEDIA RELEASE, August 2, 2017
KINGSTON, ON — Below average provincial funding of about 1.4 per cent for the newly amalgamated Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC) in 2017, “is bad news for patient care and cause for alarm at a time of significant change,” said Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) 1974 president Mike Rodrigues at a media conference today.
A general 3.1 per cent increase in hospital funding was proposed in the 2017 provincial budget last April.</description>

      <title>Why is it an advantage to be in a Union?</title>

      <description>Hospital workers who are CUPE members have a huge advantage over non-union workers because CUPE members are protected by a strong Collective Agreement.
When you join a Union you negotiate a Collective Agreement that sets out such things as:
 Vacation Entitlement (unreduced percentage in lieu or time off, increased with length of service); Rates of Pay and regular procession through pay grids; Fair Shift Scheduling Process &amp;amp; schedules posted in advance; Job Security Language including due to technological change; Layoff &amp;amp; Recall Rights; Health &amp;amp; Safety; and Discipline &amp;amp; Termination for Just Cause only  When you have a Collective Agreement the employer must abide by the rights and benefits set out in the Contract and must follow any and all procedures set out there as well.</description>

      <description>CUPE Local 1974 Newsletter Wage harmonization will follow merger of KGH and Hotel Dieu With the merger of KGH and Hotel Dieu, a vote will be held to decide which union will represent staff at the new hospital.
CUPE has a much stronger contract than OPSEU does, especially in the area of job security. This will be very important because downsizing follows hospital mergers.
Once the staff have decided which union will represent them, negotiations begin to deal with any differences in rates of pay that may exist between workers at the different hospital sites who are doing the same work.</description>

      <description>Nursing Graduate Guarantee Programme Changes Changes made to the Nursing Graduate Guarantee Programme in April concern CUPE because it more strongly encourages the hiring into full-time positions of nurses who have just graduated from community college.
Many RPNs work part-time for years waiting to acquire the seniority to post successfully into a full-time position with benefits.
Th real problem the Ministry of Health needs to address are the budget cuts to Ontario Hospitals.</description>

      <description>The problem of violence against care staff Ontario healthcare workers are subject to a higher rate of workplace violence than policing or corrections.
Some of the violence is so severe that the staff member who is assaulted will never work again.
CUPE conducted focus groups on violence at hospitals and long term care facilities across Ontario in 2016 and 2017, in conjunction with the University of Stirling. The findings will be published in an international journal of occupational health and safety this fall.</description>

      <title>What if I am non-union?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When hospitals merge, workers who are union members have a huge advantage over non-union workers. Union members are protected by a collective agreement that offers superior protection against layoffs. If your employer is considering a merger with other hospitals, you should seriously consider joining a union that will fight for your rights.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>What is Harmonization? Harmonization is the process of taking the Collective Agreements from all the union’s involved in the merger, along with any non union working conditions, and merging them into the new ‘first’ Collective Agreement.
Some employers see a merger as an opportunity to table concessions to Collective Agreements or non union working conditions but CUPE negotiates to maintain superior conditions and believes that you should not lose hard won rights and benefits due to a merger.</description>

      <description>Management’s message A good employer will respect your right to make an informed decision about whether joining CUPE is the right choice for you and your colleagues. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for employers to be afraid that you will join the Union so they resort to using union busting companies or the tactics promoted by those companies. These tactics typically take one of two directions. Either they take the &amp;lsquo;sweet talking&amp;rsquo; direction or they choose to &amp;lsquo;exploit fear of the unknown&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The Ontario Labour Relations Act (OLRA) In Ontario the OLRA protects the rights of workers to join a Union. Sections 70 and 72 of the OLRA prohibit employers from interfering with an employee’s right to join a union and ensures that employees are free from coercion, intimidation, threats, promises or undue influence, including reprisals for their support and involvement with the union. If the employer violates those rights CUPE will file an Unfair Labour Practice application with the Labour Board.</description>

      <description>As you know the employer recently put out a notice letting employees know that all employees can apply for jobs at all sites within the newly merger Hospital and this has raised a number of questions by our members. Over the last couple of weeks CUPE has met with the employer at both Providence and St. Joseph’s.
What should I do if I hold a position at more than one location?</description>
