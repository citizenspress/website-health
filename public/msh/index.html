	      <h1>Clerical employees at Markham Stouffville Hospital are joining CUPE</h1>

    <p>Back in January 2004, the Cottage Hospital Uxbridge was placed under the jurisdiction of Markham Stouffville Hospital. At that time, and up until recently, the work performed at both sites has remained separate. However, recently there have been some changes at the Uxbridge location and work that was normally performed by employees at the Uxbridge site has been moved to the Markham Stouffville site. These employees are members of CUPE Local 6364.</p>
<p>

As a result of this ‘intermingling’ of work, CUPE will be filing a PSLRTA Application. This application could affect employees at Markham Stouffville Hospital including non-union clerical employees. Please be assured that this Application will in no way result in job losses or unionized workers taking non-union employee positions. Job loss can only result in the Hospital deciding to restructure or cutback positions.
</p>
<p>
CUPE is currently organizing the non union clerical at the Markham Stouffville location so that these employees can enjoy the same rights and benefits as the members of Local 6364 including job security, job posting language, a fair process for shift scheduling and schedules posted weeks in advance for a 6 week period.</p>
<p>Find out more about how CUPE can help.  Contact us at <a href="mailto:ontarioorganizer@cupe.ca">ontarioorganizer@cupe.ca</a> or at <a href="tel:1-877-533-2873">1-877-533-2873</a>.

<p>  We&#39;ve heard from many of you about the misinformation and confusion spread by HR in a series of info sessions held last week. We would like to restore some facts into the discussion. Also, while it is disappointing that the employer did not allow CUPE representatives to be present in these sessions to directly answer employees&#39; questions or concerns, we will continue to be available for information and support.

    <a href="/news/violence-news-2017-11-16/"><h3>CUPE Anti-Violence Campaign News</h3></a>
<p>  CUPE/OCHU&#39;s anti-violence campaign received extensive media coverage. The media reported on the polling and stories of physical attacks, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, violence in Ontario hospitals. Every day, frontline caregivers are suffering serious injuries that lead to time off work and even post-traumatic stress disorder. Instead of protecting their staff, hospital managers discourage them from reporting incidents and have even fired a nurse for revealing the real epidemic of violence in healthcare.

<p>  CUPE represents about 20,000 registered practical nurses (RPNs) in Ontario. That’s more than any other union. CUPE bargaining sets the lead for all hospital service, RPN, and clerical workers in Ontario. Comparing our collective agreements to other unions bears this out. CUPE has superior language on seniority rights, job security, layoffs and recall, and health and safety to name but a few issues. This is true at Kingston General Hospital and at hospitals across the province.

<p>  More than 150 hospital staff from Kingston Health Sciences Centre KHSC), represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE 1974) will board several buses early Friday (October 27, 2017) morning and head to Ottawa. There, they will join hundreds of other hospital workers from across Ontario, for a noon rally at Ottawa’s Montfort Hospital, calling for better provincial funding for hospitals. The Ottawa rally is organized by the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU/CUPE), CUPE’s hospital division in Ontario.

<p>  A small investment in a Plexiglass barrier would have prevented a patient from stabbing a Perth/Smiths Falls hospital admitting clerk in the neck. Better alarms would have enabled nurses at Hamilton&#39;s St. Joseph&#39;s Health Centre to summon help when a patient, asked to take his medication, became violent. A nurse at a Royal Ottawa site was stabbed repeatedly by a previously violent patient and the hospital fined earlier this summer for failing to &#34;reassess the risk of workplace violence&#34; as required by the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

<p>  KINGSTON, ON — Below average provincial funding of about 1.4 per cent for the newly amalgamated Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC) in 2017, “is bad news for patient care and cause for alarm at a time of significant change,” said Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) 1974 president Mike Rodrigues at a media conference today.

    <a href="/news/managements-message-2016-01-01/"><h3>What to expect from your Employer</h3></a>
<p>  A good employer will respect your right  to make an informed decision about whether joining CUPE is the right choice  for you and your colleagues. However, it&#39;s not unusual for employers  to be afraid that you will join the Union so  they resort to using union busting companies or the tactics promoted by  those companies.

    <a href="/news/union-rights-2016-01-01/"><h3>Your right to join a union is protected by law in Ontario.</h3></a>
<p>  In Ontario the OLRA protects the rights of  workers to join a Union. Sections 70 and  72 of the OLRA prohibit employers from  interfering with an employee’s right to  join a union and ensures that employees  are free from coercion, intimidation,  threats, promises or undue influence,  including reprisals for their support and  involvement with the union. If the  employer violates those rights CUPE will  file an Unfair Labour Practice application  with the Labour Board.
