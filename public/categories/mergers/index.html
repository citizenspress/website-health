Listen to the podcast here.

Hello CUPE supporters!
As you may be aware, there has been a merger between Providence, St. Joseph’s and St. Michael’s hospitals as of August 1, 2017.
With any public sector merger such as this, there are government regulations that guide the process. When merging workplaces with many unions, there must be a vote by the workers to select a single union to represent the newly merged workplace.

    &ldquo;Ontario hospitals don&rsquo;t want you to know that violence against hospital staff is real and rampant,&rdquo; says union taking public awareness campaign to radio today
 Media Release
October 17, 2017
TORONTO, ON - A small investment in a Plexiglass barrier would have prevented a patient from stabbing a Perth/Smiths Falls hospital admitting clerk in the neck. Better alarms would have enabled nurses at Hamilton&rsquo;s St. Joseph&rsquo;s Health Centre to summon help when a patient, asked to take his medication, became violent.

    St. Joseph’s Health Centre is in the process of making a decision about how to prepare and deliver food in its cafeteria.
Rather than serve “TV dinner” style food from a factory operation outside of Toronto, we think the hospital should consider patient well-being and the needs of the community.
We are calling on St. Joseph’s to:  Serve food that is cooked in-house Use good quality, fresh ingredients Use locally sourced, organic food when possible Focus on patient well-being, not cutting corners  There is a local food solution Parkdale is already home to a local food movement.

    <h4><a href="/news/msh-joining-union/">Joining a Union</a></h4>
    Often during an union organizing drive workers and the employer will focus primarily on monetary issues.
Employers will often scare workers into believing that they will take home less as a result of paying union dues.
The fact is that unionized workers earn more than non union workers. That is one of the reasons why employers don&rsquo;t want a union in the workplace. The other reason they don&rsquo;t want a union is because they lose the absolute control they currently have.
