      <description>CUPE Local 1974 Newsletter Wage harmonization will follow merger of KGH and Hotel Dieu With the merger of KGH and Hotel Dieu, a vote will be held to decide which union will represent staff at the new hospital.
CUPE has a much stronger contract than OPSEU does, especially in the area of job security. This will be very important because downsizing follows hospital mergers.
Once the staff have decided which union will represent them, negotiations begin to deal with any differences in rates of pay that may exist between workers at the different hospital sites who are doing the same work.</description>
