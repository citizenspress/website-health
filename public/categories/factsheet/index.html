    <h4><a href="/news/managements-message-2016-01-01/">What to expect from your Employer</a></h4>
    Management’s message A good employer will respect your right to make an informed decision about whether joining CUPE is the right choice for you and your colleagues. However, it&rsquo;s not unusual for employers to be afraid that you will join the Union so they resort to using union busting companies or the tactics promoted by those companies. These tactics typically take one of two directions. Either they take the &lsquo;sweet talking&rsquo; direction or they choose to &lsquo;exploit fear of the unknown&rsquo;.

    <h4><a href="/news/union-rights-2016-01-01/">Your right to join a union is protected by law in Ontario.</a></h4>
    The Ontario Labour Relations Act (OLRA) In Ontario the OLRA protects the rights of workers to join a Union. Sections 70 and 72 of the OLRA prohibit employers from interfering with an employee’s right to join a union and ensures that employees are free from coercion, intimidation, threats, promises or undue influence, including reprisals for their support and involvement with the union. If the employer violates those rights CUPE will file an Unfair Labour Practice application with the Labour Board.
