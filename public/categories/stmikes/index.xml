      <title>Restoring the Facts at St. Mike&#39;s</title>

      <description>Dear CUPE supporter, We’ve heard from many of you about the misinformation and confusion spread by HR in a series of “info sessions” held last week. We would like to restore some facts into the discussion:
 CUPE absolutely can and will protect against layoffs. Our hospital collective agreements have the strongest job security provisions in the industry. CUPE members are entitled to: 5 months notice in advance of layoffs, retraining for other positions within the hospital, bumping rights, recall rights from a layoff to an available opening and layoff benefits and separation allowances.</description>

      <description>Hospital workers who are CUPE members have a huge advantage over non-union workers because CUPE members are protected by a strong Collective Agreement.
When you join a Union you negotiate a Collective Agreement that sets out such things as:
 Vacation Entitlement (unreduced percentage in lieu or time off, increased with length of service); Rates of Pay and regular procession through pay grids; Fair Shift Scheduling Process &amp;amp; schedules posted in advance; Job Security Language including due to technological change; Layoff &amp;amp; Recall Rights; Health &amp;amp; Safety; and Discipline &amp;amp; Termination for Just Cause only  When you have a Collective Agreement the employer must abide by the rights and benefits set out in the Contract and must follow any and all procedures set out there as well.</description>

      <description>Technological changes pose particular issues for clerical staff  Digitization of medical records Automation of dicta-typing and medical transcription Electronic patient registration kiosks  These are just some examples of the revolution through technological change taking place in hospitals across Ontario, which is eliminating the jobs of clerical employees.
In our central bargaining with Ontario hospitals, CUPE is seeking increased protections against the impact of technological changes on clerical staff.</description>
